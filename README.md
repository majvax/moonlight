This repositories is for my minecraft autocliker website, (it also contains the autocliker itself)
but infortunatly, i have lost the source so i won't recommend anyone to download it.
The autoclicker is a fork of [this github](https://github.com/b1scoito/clicker). I have only
change the gui because i was not satisfied.
